                    India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world 
                    with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage. 
                    It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since 
                    Independence. As the 7th largest country in the world, India 
                    stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by
                    mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct 
                    geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the 
                    north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, 
                    tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on 
                    the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.
